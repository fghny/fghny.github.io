      <h2>Weekday Meetings</h2>

      </br>
      <h3>Lord’s Day Morning Worship Meeting</h3>

<p>At the worship Meeting, you will notice a table in the center with a loaf of bread and a cup of wine on it. Though these are just symbols, however, they are very graphic emblems rich in meaning: the bread reminds us of a body of the Lord Jesus and the cup of His Precious Blood. Taken together they remind us of the vicarious death of our Lord Jesus Christ. Following His command at upper room shortly before His death at Calvary, we are “remembering Him”(1 Corinthian 11: 24) in worship and communion by breaking bread and drink the cup.</p>

<p>And the cup reminds us of the communion of the blood of Christ and the bread of the communion of the body of Christ. Scripture tells us that forgiveness of sin is through His blood and that forgiven sinners become members of body of Christ. We have been “called to the fellowship of His Son: Jesus Christ our Lord.” In keeping with the New Testament Pattern, various brethren guided simply by the Spirit of God will lead in worship until the bread and cup are distributed to those in the local fellowship. Hymns will also be given out during the service by various brethren as Holy Spirit guides. </p>

<p>For convenience there will be an offering taken for the Lord’s work following the bread and wine. However, you will not be solicited nor will we take an offering from any person not in assembly fellowship. At the time of closing of Worship, a brother may read and comment upon portion of the Bible for devotional. </p>

<p>While all are cordially invited to observe the Worship Meeting, as the scripture teaches, sharing the bread and cup is only for those who are in the fellowship of the assembly or visiting from similarly gathered fellowship with a letter of commendation (Rom 16: 1,2, Act 18: 27) This is not an effort to discriminate or to judge the salvation of visitors but is a protection for both the assembly and the visitor. This gives the visitor the opportunity to observe and learn how we follow only the direction of the Word of God for instruction in the Worship Meeting.  </p>

<h3>Lord’s Day Ministry Meeting</h3>

<p>Each Lord’s Day, message from the Word of God is delivered for the spiritual needs of the believers. Our conviction is that a good quality of life start with a proper relationship with your God through knowing His Son Jesus Christ revealed in His Word, the Bible. Ministry of the Word always gives spiritual foods to believers by edification, encouragement, exhortation.</p>

<p></br></p>

<h3>Lord&#39;s Day Gospel Meeting</h3>

<p>All are welcome to come along and hear the simple, plain yet Bible based message of the Gospel being preached. Services run for one hour and there are no collections at this or any other service. Biblical definition of “Gospel” is clearly stated as follow. “For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that He was buried and that He rose again the third day according to the scripture.”(1 Corinthians 15: 3-4) This meeting will commence by singing a few hymns and opened in prayer. Normally there will be two speakers who will each have a 30 minutes message. The grace, mercy and love of God will be presented as well as the great blessing of knowing sins forgiven and having eternal life. The Bible is clear that there is only one method of salvation and that is through the finished work of the Lord Jesus Christ on the cross of Calvary.</p>

<p></br></p>

<h3>Lord&#39;s Day Sunday School</h3>

<p>We share a concern for both you and your family. Whether you are coming alone or with your family we have classes for all ages. We begin this time by singing choruses with the children. Following the singing the children will go to various classes belonging to their age group. All children, of all ages are welcome. Currently we have three main class divisions – Toddlers, Pre-teenagers, and Teenagers and Young Adults. Every second Lord’s Day, the message is delivered for all Sunday school children and adults. </p>

<p></br></p>

<h3>Bible Reading (Lord&#39;s Day and Wednesdays)</h3>

<p>The Bible Reading is where the Scriptures are opened and outlined and discussed. We have two Bible Readings each week. Lord’s Day afternoon, we study a book in New Testaments and on Wednesday evening, we study one selected book in Old Testament. You will find our Bible studies both doctrinally instructive and practically encouraging. This Bible studies should serve to deepen your interest in God’s Word. Currently, we study the book of Hebrew on Lord’s Day, and the book of Jeremiah on Wednesday evening.</p>

      <h2>Monthly Meetings</h2>

      </br>
      <h3>Youth Meeting</h3>

<p>Once every month, the young people gather and study the Bible (currently we are studying the book of 1st Kings). Youthes living in these perilous times needs concrete faith, spiritual wisdom, discernment, and discipline in the word of God. Young people find spiritual strength, vision, and encouragement during the three sessions of Bible study and youth fellowship. In each meeting, lunch is served.</p>

<p></br></p>

<h3>ESL Gospel Meeting</h3>

<p>This is the time of Gospel outreach for international students. Every month, on a Saturday, ESL students are invited to listen to the proclaimed Gospel message. After the public message, students are invited to have refreshments and have fellowship. In this time, students get to know each other and engage in conversation and receive answers to any questions they might have. </p>
