The theme for this year's Vacation Bible School at Flushing Gospel Hall will be centered on **The Voyage with Christ**. Children, from a very young age, are faced with many dangerous obstacles that prevent them from enjoying truly happy, successful, and fruitful lives. The lives of our children are indeed like that of a ship navigating through stormy waters, trying to reach its destination safely. For a safe journey through life's voyage, our children not only have to avoid life's perilous tempest, but need a trustworthy guide and a steadfast anchor that can guarantee eternal safety.

The absolute condition for a happy and successful voyage lies in the person of Jesus Christ. This summer, it is our sincere desire to share the Gospel (*"Good News"*) with your children through the Word of God (*the Bible*). In His Word, God reflects upon our individual need for a Savior and reveals the invitation that is given freely to all men, women, boys and girls to know their sins forgiven and to have eternal life. It is our prayer that your children will be saved, grow in grace and knowledge of Christ and  safely voyage in a transformed life through Christ as children of God.
