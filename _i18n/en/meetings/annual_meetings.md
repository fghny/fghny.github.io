### Sunday School Treat

The Sunday School children put on a performance of the main themes of the Gospel and what they have learned from the Bible during the previous term. The children are rewarded with prizes for their Sunday School attendance and their hard work over the year, including reciting memory verses. Events are conducted at the end of Vacation Bible School and the Year-End Assembly Gathering.

### Vacation Bible School (VBS)

In late August, just before the start of school, kids of all ages come to enjoy  four days of VBS. Every day from 10 AM to 3: 00 PM, students will receive Bible lessons. Other activities include Singing, Group Activities, exciting Crafts, Quizes, and Memory verses. Each day snacks and hot meals will be provided. There is no charge for attending VBS.

### Assembly Picnic

We have a large number of guests who come along each year to enjoy and take part in the festivities, games and of course … picnic food!!  The picnic is held at the Saturday just prior to Memorial Day.

### Ministry Series 

A four day ministry series is conducted in July and a one week ministry meeting is held at the end of the year (from Christmas day up to New Years Eve). The ministry meetings are held from Thursday to Lord’s Day. Each evening before the meeting, supper is served at 6: 30 PM. Ministry from the Word of God is held every evening starting at 8: 00 PM.

### Gospel Series at Retreat Center

In the third or fourth week of July, we hold our Bible Conference from Monday to Thursday. Activities that are regularly held include ministry meetings and Gospel meetings, Bible school, devotionals, prayer meetings, testimonies, afternoon physical activities, and fellowship hours. This conference is held at retreat centers located in either New Jersey or Pennsylvania. Every year many guests visit from Canada, USA, and abroad.
