### Youth Meeting

Once every month, the young people gather and study the Bible (currently we are studying the book of 1st Kings). Youthes living in these perilous times needs concrete faith, spiritual wisdom, discernment, and discipline in the word of God. Young people find spiritual strength, vision, and encouragement during the three sessions of Bible study and youth fellowship. In each meeting, lunch is served.

### ESL Gospel Meeting

This is the time of Gospel outreach for international students. Every month, on a Saturday, ESL students are invited to listen to the proclaimed Gospel message. After the public message, students are invited to have refreshments and have fellowship. In this time, students get to know each other and engage in conversation and receive answers to any questions they might have.
