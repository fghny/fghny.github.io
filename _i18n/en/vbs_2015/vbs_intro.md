We are your neighbors and we are born again Christians who gather unto the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We want to share the glad tidings of Christ at this summer's Vacation Bible School. We trust that in these perilous time, your children need to meet the **Savior** and come to know eternal truth through Christ. For this important reason, we are pleased to invite your children.


We cordially invite you and your children to the 2015 Summer Vacation Bible School at Flushing Gospel Hall. The Gospel message will be proclaimed in a safe and welcoming environment. Everything is **free**. There are **no collections** and **no gifts** are requested nor accepted. Your children will discover many interesting subjects in the Bible and enjoy many wholesome and interesting activities in Christ with other children under the careful supervision of many teachers.

 
As parents, we certainly know that you would like to meet the teachers who will be spending time with your children. For this reason we would cordially invite you to an Open House on June 20, 2015 at 1:30 to 4:00 PM here at Flushing Gospel Hall. We would also like to meet you and answer your questions.
