      <h2>What Your Children Will Learn and Experience</h2>

<h3>Hymn Singing</h3>

<p>All children attending VBS will learn various hymns or simple Sunday School songs that are both inspired by and contain messages from the Bible. We believe that singing is one of the best ways to not only just learn Bible stories, but also to have a better understanding of the Word of God itself. We also wish to enjoy our time with your children by sharing the same songs that had many a life-changing impact on our own lives as well.</p>

<h3>Open Messages &amp; Divided Classes</h3>

<p>Since our Summer VBS centers directly from the Bible, we will apportion a good amount of time to teach your children the Word of God. The Bible is not an easy text for adults, and can be intimidating for children. Classes will be held in two sessions. The first session will be an open session, where the speaker will give a message to all age groups. Your children will be divided into classes according to their age with an individual teacher and the second session will reinforce what was previously taught.</p>

<h3>Memory Verses</h3>

<p>Once again, the Bible izs the primary source for everything that will be shared with your children. <em>&quot;All scripture</em> (all messages from the Bible) <em>is given by inspiration of God,</em> (a message given from God Himself) <em>and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness.&quot;</em> (<em>2nd Timothy 3:15-17</em>) All teaching and messages conveyed from us would have no meaning, unless it is directly from His Word. We will be expecting your children to not only learn and memorize what was written and preserved in this precious book, but more importantly to not just idly listen to what we say, but search for themselves and have the conviction that what was written has direct application to their own lives. Many of us can give accounts of how such words served as an anchor for our own heart and soul down the road of our lives from a very young age.</p>

<h3>Quiz and Games</h3>

<p>Although your children will be learning a lot this summer, it is still our desire to be sure that your children have an enjoyable experience and are rewarded for their undivided attention as well. Many of the Quiz and Games, like the lessons, serve as a reinforcement for what was taught earlier, and will hopefully capture the importance of what is taught in His Word, the Bible.</p>

<h3>Crafts</h3>

<p>In addition to the lessons, memory verses, and challenges provided by the instructors and speakers this summer, we hope to share the message of the Gospel with your children through crafts, and many other art activities. We want your children to be able to utilize their creativity and to actively think of what was taught through various hands-on activities and to have special memories of the time spent with us. All materials for the crafts and activities will be provided by us, and the only thing your children will need are their thinking-caps and enthusiasm to learn more from the Bible.</p>

<h3>Snacks and Hot Lunch</h3>

<p>With an entire day spent through various lessons, activities and challenges, your children will no doubt be hungry before the day is over. We will happily provide both a hot meal and additional snacks and beverages to satisfy your children&#39;s appetites.</p>

<h3>Prayer</h3>

<p>Lastly, prayer will be conducted and taught in all our class sessions and activities spent together. Prayer is one of the greatest privileges given by God, and through which dependence and fellowship with Him is exercised.</p>
