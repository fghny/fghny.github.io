      <h3>What the Bible Teaches About the Bible</h3>

<ul>
<li>The Bible alone is the inspired Word of God.  The Old Testament was validated by Christ and the New Testament was authorized by Christ as being the Word of God.  There is no subsequent nor other written revelation from God.</li>
<li>The inspiration of the original autographs of the Bible is verbal, plenary, flawless, and final.</li>
<li>The Bible&#39;s message is universally authoritative, historically accurate, personally transforming, and eternally relevant.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What the Bible Teaches About God</h3>

<ul>
<li>There is one true God: infinite in being, eternally coexisting in three persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</li>
<li>God is revealed as holy, righteous, eternal, omniscient, omnipotent, omnipresent, and sovereign.</li>
<li>The eternal Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, became man; possessing both full Deity and sinless, perfect humanity.

<ul>
<li>His holy character and morally flawless life displayed the glory of God.</li>
<li>His death at Calvary was purposed eternally.  That death was necessary to meet God&#39;s righteous sentence of judgment against us for having broken His holy law.</li>
<li>He physically arose from the dead and ascended into heaven.</li>
<li>The account of His death as a sacrifice for sin, His burial and resurrection comprise the message known as the Gospel.</li>
<li>He will ultimately return to earth to establish His righteous kingdom.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>What the Bible Teaches About Man</h3>

<ul>
<li>Adam, the head of the human family, created in the image of God, sinned against God through disobedience of God&#39;s commandment.</li>
<li>We, consequently, live in a creation ruined by that original sin.  And we, ourselves, sin repeatedly since by our very nature we are sinners and will be held accountable by God for our personal sin.</li>
<li>Our sin is a violation of God&#39;s holy law: God&#39;s righteousness requires eternal punishment against us because of that sin.</li>
<li>God provides salvation to every person who will acknowledge their need and receive His salvation in Christ.</li>
<li>Every person will exist eternally either in God&#39;s kingdom or under His Judgment by their own choice of accepting or rejecting God&#39;s offer of salvation. </li>
</ul>

<h3>What the Bible Teaches About the Person and Work of Christ</h3>

<ul>
<li>The Lord Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God, became man, without ceasing to be God, having been conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary, in order that He might reveal God and redeem sinful men.</li>
<li>The Lord Jesus Christ accomplished our redemption through His death on the cross as a representative, vicarious, substitutionary sacrifice; and, that our justification is made sure by His literal, physical resurrection from the dead.</li>
<li>The Lord Jesus ascended to Heaven and is now exalted at the right hand of God where, as our High Priest, He fulfills the ministry of Representative, Intercessor, and Advocate. </li>
</ul>

<h3>What Bible Teaches About the Person and Work of the Holy Spirit</h3>

<ul>
<li>The Holy Spirit is a divine person who convicts the world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment; and, that He is the Supernatural Agent in regeneration, baptizing all believers into the body of Christ, indwelling and sealing them unto the day of redemption.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What the Bible Teaches About Salvation</h3>

<ul>
<li>Personal salvation is necessary for all and is received by faith alone in Christ and His atoning death.</li>
<li>Repentance of sin and believing in Christ as Savior and Lord results in the complete forgiveness of sins and present possession of eternal life.</li>
<li>Salvation is an instantaneous, once-for-all moment that secures eternal life which can never be lost.</li>
<li>Every person who is saved is immediately indwelled by the Spirit of God and born into the family of God.</li>
<li>Through the Holy Spirit, God empowers and purposes for each person to live that they might glorify God.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What the Bible Teaches About the Church</h3>

<ul>
<li>All who have trusted Christ for personal salvation become members of His church which, mystically, is His body.</li>
<li>Local gatherings of Christians &quot;in His name&quot; and owning His authority comprise local assembly testimony.</li>
<li>The mission of the local church is to glorify God in worship, nurture Christian growth of believers and proclaim the Gospel and pray together.</li>
<li>The responsibility for function of the local church involves the priesthood of all believers.</li>
<li>The authority for the function of the local church is, alone, the Word of God administered by spiritually minded overseers acknowledging the authority of the Lord.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What the Bible Teaches About the Future</h3>

<ul>
<li>The return of the Lord Jesus to the air to rapture all who are saved is imminent.</li>
<li>The rise of the Anti-Christ and the Great Tribulation will follow, culminating in the return of Christ to earth with His church to judge the nations.</li>
<li>The Lord Jesus will establish His kingdom on earth for a period of one thousand years.</li>
<li>The Lord Jesus will subdue the final rebellion of Satan, who will be consigned to the lake of fire forever.</li>
<li>The Lord Jesus will judge all who rejected Him in their lifetime at the Great White Thrown and consign them to the lake of fire forever.</li>
<li>The new heavens and new earth will be created, the kingdom of God will be established, and the Day of God will begin with eternal reward and blessing for all the redeemed in Christ.</li>
</ul>
